%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type.
   Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.
   Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for style and length.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

In the following we will introduce in all the concepts we used in our project. This ranges from Grab Cut over 3D reconstruction on to volume rendering.

Further we would like to shortly introduce all libraries we used for our implementation.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Libraries}

We shortly describe which library is used to what extent and use.

\begin{description}
	\item[Android SDK] We used the android software developer kit mostly to get a good user interface. Only a few lightweight calculations are done in Java.
	\item[Android NDK] All time intensive computing is done in the android native development kit since this improves performance by lengths.
	\item[vuforia] The relative position to the marker is given by the vuforia library. The application was derived from a sample within the vuforia package.
	\item[OpenCV] The GrabCut implementation was the main reason to use OpenCV but also matrix calculations, point projections and image scaling are present.
	\item[OpenGL ES] To display the reconstructed object we used OpenGL shaders. This gives a reasonable number of frames per second.
\end{description}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Grab Cut}

In our project Grab Cut is used to segment the pictures we record into the foreground - the object - and the background - the marker and everything around.

The input is a rectangle which fully contains the foreground object and possibly some refinement strokes to improve the segmentation into foreground and background. As output we get an image with four possible values:

\begin{description}
	\item[Surely foreground] Pxels marked as foreground by the user.
	\item[Probably foreground] Pixels the algorithm assumes are foreground.
	\item[Surely background] Pixels marked as background by the user or outside the rectangle.
	\item[Probably background] Pixels the algorithm assumes are background.
\end{description}

We didn't actually implement GrabCut as the OpenCV library presents an all ready implementation of the GrabCut as presented by C. Rother \etal \cite{Rother}. Our contribution was to implement an easy to use interface in our application.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{3D Reconstruction}

The first approach to this problem would have been to use the paper "Exact Voxel Occupancy with Graph Cuts" by D. Snow \etal \cite{Snow} Sadly this approach turned out to be computationally too expensive as well as too cumbersome to use on an android device as this would have meant to compile another library to android native code.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Volume Rendering}

Describe volume rendering.

\section{The Application}

Now that all the necessairy knowledge is introduced we would like to go into some parts of our project in depth.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Class diagram}

Here we state which class is used in which state and how they communicate with each other

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Grab Cut selection}

This explains how the strokes are captured and relayied to the native code

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Matrix handling}

Here we explain how the matrix contents are gathered and used

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Texture usage}

Here we explain the concept of using a 2D texture to simulate a 3D texture

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusions}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Advantages of a mobile solution}

We blable about how nice it is that it is all on the phone now... yay!

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Possible Improvements}

We tell them what part we screwed up (Multithreading, etc.) As in the presentation.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Limitations}

We talk about the problem that only the visual hull can be reconstructed using this technique and that voxel carving would be so much nicer but probably not feasible.
